# Project Euler Language Project

This is my attempt to learn diffrent languages through solving the problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

## Language speed

It is of course expected that Go is gnerally the fasted being a compiled lanugage. but the diffrence between the non complied laguages is interesting. I encurage you to look through the results.

### Language Speed Wins

| Language   | Wins  |
| ---------- | ----- |
| Go ðŸ”¥      | 9     |
| Java       | 1     |
| Python     | 0     |
| Javascript | 0     |

### Language Speed Looses

| Language        | Looses  |
| --------------- | ------- |
| Javascript ðŸ’©  | 6       |
| Python          | 4       |
| Java            | 1       |
| Go ðŸ”¥           | 0       |
