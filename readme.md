# Project Euler Language Project

This is my attempt to learn different languages through solving the problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/).

I am attempting to make the same implementation across languages where possible.

## Language speed

It is of course expected that Go is generally the fasted being a compiled language. but the difference between the non complied languages is interesting. I encourage you to look through the results.

### Language Speed Wins

| Language   | Wins  |
| ---------- | ----- |
| Go ðŸ”¥      | 10    |
| Java       | 4     |
| Rust       | 2     |
| Python     | 1     |
| Javascript | 0     |
| C#         | 0     |

### Language Speed Looses

| Language        | Losses  |
| --------------- | ------- |
| Javascript      | 8       |
| Python          | 6       |
| Java            | 2       |
| C#              | 1       |
| Go              | 0       |
| Rust            | 0       |
