# Problem 006

## Sum square difference

>The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
>
>$1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385$
>
>The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
>
>$(1 + 2+...+ 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025$
>
>Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is $3025 - 385 = 2640$.
>
>Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
